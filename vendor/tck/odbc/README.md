# Laravel ODBC Connector

This is a simple ODBC connector for Laravel 4/5.

### Installation
Add this to the require section in your composer.json file
```
"tck/odbc": "dev-master"
```

In your config/app.php file add the Service Provider to the service providers array like so...
```
'TCK\Odbc\OdbcServiceProvider',
```

Now in your config/database.php you will need to add your connection details, it'll look something like this...
```
'odbc'   => [
	'driver'   => 'odbc',
	'dsn'      => 'odbc:DB_CONNECTION_STRING', //
	'host'     => 'DB_HOST',
	'database' => 'DB_NAME,
	'username' => 'DB_USERNAME',
	'password' => 'DB_PASSWORD',
],
```

#### Custom Grammar
To use SQL Server or other database engines, set the grammar in the config:
```
'odbc'   => [
	...
	'grammar' => [
		'query' => Illuminate\Database\Query\Grammars\SqlServerGrammar::class,
		'schema' => Illuminate\Database\Schema\Grammars\SqlServerGrammar::class,
	],
],
```


### Usage
Now in your app you can do something like...

```
$data = DB::connection('odbc')->get('tableName')->all();
```

Alternatively, in an Eloquent model you could something like this
```
class Users extends Eloquent {

	protected $connection = 'odbc';
}
```

### DB_CONNECTION_STRING - Something to note
Dependant upon your database configuration, I personally had some difficulty in working out what the DB_CONNECTION_STRING needed to be.

This was some trial and error (with a hell of a lot of Googling!) but you could either use a path, something like...
```
'dsn'      => 'odbc:\\\\path\to\my\database',
```

Or a connection name
```
'dsn'      => 'odbc:\\\\my-connection-name',
```

Hopefully, this will help you!
